*1 Melbourne, Graham Geddes coll. P 5:2. Ht. 19-3, diam. 27/21. PLATE 166 
Ex Basel Market, MuM, Auktion 60, 21 Sept. 1982, no. 44, ill. on pi. 21; Sonderliste U, 
p. 34, no. 54, ill. on pp. 35-6. 
The vase has the form of a lekanis, with figured decoration around the lid and a frontal 
white female head on the knob. Internally it is divided into four compartments, around a 
central well, and each compartment is fitted with a lid decorated in red-figure, with two small 
perforated holes at the top. A comparable r.f. vase is B.M. F 139 [CVA 2, IV Ea, pi. 4,11; LCS, 
p. 211, no. 64 and Suppl. Ill, p. 105, no. 105, where it is attributed to the Revel Painter), and 
another, in the Gnathia technique, is B.M. F 502 [CVA 1, IV Dc, pi. 8,15-16), although the 
former lacks a covering lid, and the latter individual lids to the four compartments. An earlier 
example of a Paestan vase divided internally into compartments, each with a figured lid, will 
be found in the remarkable hydria at present on the London market (no. 2/85; PI. 37); a 
somewhat later lepaste (no. 165), also in the Geddes collection, is divided internally into four 
compartments, like the present vase, which may well have served as its model, although there 
are no individual lids for the compartments. 
Lid: Young satyr in front of seated draped woman, young silen capering by nude woman 
(white flesh), approached from behind by a young silen, with a nude boy bending down 
behind him, standing draped woman, nude woman at laver beside which is a swan. 
Knob: Frontal female head, with face in added white, now largely worn off. 
Interior: (i) woman seated on dotted rock, veined palmette leaf to r.; (ii) nude youth 
bending forward in front of altar; (iii) as for (i) with leaf to 1.; (iv) as for (ii) though the youth 
is here not so close to the altar.

come several other vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778 (inv. 22308-9, 22314-6; nos. 130, 164, 
190, 22), as well as a Campanian lekanis (22310) by the CA Painter. In style no. 17 is very 
close to the oenochoe 21185 (no. 53), which also comes from a tomb (T. 8) in the same area 
containing many other vases by the same painter.

Half-draped woman seated on white tendril, standing youth with drapery behind his 
back. 
Found with the lebes gamikos 6592 (no. 105 below). 

Lebetes gamikoi 

The Painter ofNaples 1778 had a taste for large lebetes gamikoi, with elaborate lids 

consisting of lekanides surmounted by a small lebes gamikos. These are all usually 

decorated with female heads of various types which will be discussed in greater detail 

in section 3 below; they definitely establish the connection between the many smaller 

vases decorated solely with a female head and the work of this painter. On most of 

the vases listed below the pictures on the obverse are framed between reserved 

bands, often with the usual triangle in the top left corner (e.g. nos. 20, 24), although 

the reverse pictures are left unframed. The shoulders are decorated with plastic 

heads and/or conical knobs.

Lekanides 

The three following lekanides (nos. 34—6) all have multiple figures right around the 

lid, as on the earlier lepaste in the Geddes collection (no. 1 above). No. 34 is an 

excellent example of the painter's standard style, with a number of his stock figures. 

Both single palmette-leaves and leafy branches spring from the ground in various 

places, and two swans in added white (now mostly worn off) enliven the scene. 

On the knob is a white-fleshed female head in profile to left; her hair is caught up in a 

red sphendone. She is the counterpart in profile to the frontal head on the earlier vase

These vases all provide excellent examples of the painter's stock figures; the small 

white Eros on no. 38 is unusual, but will appear again on nos. 166 and 188. The 

pictures on nos. 38 and 40 are framed between reserved bands; most of the others

Oenochoe (shape 10) 

*57 Paestum 21415, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 30. Ht. 38-5. PLATE 174c, a1 
Woman with open box in r. hand, moving to 1. and looking back r. to nude long-haired 
youth, with drapery over both arms, who follows her. 
The picture is framed between both palmettes and reserved bands. 

Stemless cups 

These cups have figured scenes only in the tondo, which normally has a border of 

white laurel, ivy or vine leaves. The exterior is decorated with laurel or ivy. The 

scenes mostly represent couples embracing each other in some fashion, on nos. 58-60 

in the presence of a third person. Paestum 4983 (no. 68) and 21704 (no. 69) well 

illustrate two stages in the courting process; on the former a youth rather tentatively 

puts one arm around a half-draped woman, on the other, the latter firmly grasps a 

somewhat reluctant youth by both arms to draw him closer to her. The three-figured 

scenes on nos. 58-60 are getting near to the more developed phase of the artist's style.

THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM 
In PP, and PPSupp, this vase was attributed to the Painter of Naples 2585, but the 
drawing of the woman's face, the rendering of her drapery, and the head on the neck all 
suggest that it would be better placed here. The figure on the reverse is much repainted, but it 
also looks nearer to this painter than to his colleague.

THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM 

Naples 1779 (no. 6) and the one of the Termer collection (no. 8). The hair is caught 

up in a saccos or a sphendone; in the latter instance, there is a small bunch of hair 

emerging at the back. The headdress is decorated with rows of black and white dots; 

there is usually a small stephane across the forehead, and a round bunch of hair over 

the visible ear. The mouth is small, usually with a slight downward turn (cf. the 

Painter of B.M. F63), and neither the lips nor the chin are given undue emphasis. 
Heads with a sphendone more simply decorated with a single row of black dots 

appear on the lids of the lebes gamikos Paestum 5200 (no. 25) and the one in San 

Antonio (no. 24). They look back to those of the plainer style from the Asteas-

Python workshop (e.g. nos. 2/863-72) from which they are not always readily 

distinguishable.

THE PAINTER OF NAPLES 1 778 AND VASES ASSOCIATED WITH HIM 299 

Naples 2553, Paestum 5068, 22596, 4955); similarly the red mullet (IIE/30), the 

squid (IIE/29-30), the torpedo (IIE/21 and 23), the bream (IIE/20) all find close 

parallels on the plates listed below. We may also note that the decoration round the 

central depression, consisting of black strokes on a reserved band, also finds 

prototypes on GRFP, HE/19, 21 and 23. 
Laurel, wave and ivy appear on the overhanging rim; wave or strokes normally 

around the central depression, except on the Geddes plate (no. 314) and on the 

plates in (ii), where there is no decoration. 

(i) 

The first four plates well illustrate the connection with the Torpedo Group; on many 

of them the octopus assumes its canonical shape for this division. Other connecting 

links between the plates may be seen in the red mullet, dogfish and two-banded 

bream, which constantly recur. The dotted fish on the Fogg and Capua plates is 

thought by Palombi to be a crenilabrus pavo, but it seems more like a sparus auratus.

In the exergue is a palmette-fan with inward turning leaves (contrast those on the cups in 
the Asteas-Python Group). 

(b) Vases decorated solely with heads 

The following small vases come from the same tomb as no. 326, and look to be by the 

same painter; with them there was also a small lebes gamikos (inv. 21151) which has 

been placed among the minor vases in the Asteas-Python Group (no. 2/904). The 

hair is caught up in a sphendone, decorated with large black dots; there is a single 

white dot on top of the brow, and a drop-pendant ear-ring on nos. 331-2.

With this lekanis three other vases may be associated, all decorated with similar 

heads: 

Oenochoai (shape 3) 

334 Paestum 21988, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 182. Ht. 16. 
Head of satyr wearing beaded wreath. 

335 Paestum 32394, from Spinazzo (1974), T. 48. Ht. 13. 
Head of satyr to 1. (as above). 

336 Paestum 28903, from C. Andriuolo (1969), sporadic. Act. ht. 13. 
Head of satyr to r. as on 21988. 

With the heads on nos. 331-2, those on the following are also closely connected: 

Squat lekythoi 

*337 Paestum 4834, from C. Gaudo (1957), T. 3. Ht. 11. PLATE 191 c 
PAdd, no. A 142.

*338 Paestum 4835, from C. Gaudo (1957), T. 3. Ht. 12. PLATE 191 d 
PAdd, no. A 141. 
Female head, as above. 

These two vases come from a tomb which contained several others by the 

Painter ofNaples 1778 (4831 = no. 20; 4832 = no. 202; 4833 = no. 70; 4836 = no. 

184), but the heads on nos. 337-8, which are by a single hand, look, from the 
THE PAINTER OF NAPLES 2585 AND HIS CIRCLE 

treatment of the mouth and the hair, closer to the Painter ofNaples 2585. Compare 

also the head on the small chous 31916 (no. 294 above, PI. 188 A) with that on no. 

338, where the drawing of the mouth and lower lip, and the rendering of the hair, 

are different, despite the apparent similarity in the treatment of the brow and nose. 

Both nos. 337 and 338 have a large triangular ornament above to left. 

*339 Paestum 6029, from C. Laghetto-Andriuolo (1955), T. 24. Ht. 20. PLATE 191 c 
PAdd, no. A 158. 
Female head to 1. 
Here again the head on this vase may be compared with that on 6028 (no. 293 above), 
associated with the Painter ofNaples 1778, to illustrate the difference between their two styles. 

*340 Paestum 5205, from Tempa del Prete (1953), T. 12. Ht. 10-5. PLATE 191/ 
PAdd, no. A 181. 
Head of youth to 1., with dotted wreath. 
This vase was also found together with several vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778—5197 
(no. 268), 5199 (no. 103), 5200 (no. 25), 5210 (no. 298), 5213 (no. 176) and 5214 (no. 18), 
but like nos. 338-9 it is closer to the Painter ofNaples 2585 (cf. the head on the lid of no. 393). 

(ii) Standard Vases 

In this division are listed the painter's standard vases, ranging from one of his earliest 

major works, the neck-amphora Paestum 5184, through to vases in his more 

developed style, like Naples 2585 (no. 420) or Paestum 22270 (no. 427), and 

representing the whole range of his stock figures. On the smaller amphorae (nos. 

346 ff.) the palmette-fans on the neck normally have inward-facing leaves.

(iii) Mature Work 

This division contains the vases from the middle and later phases of the painter's 

career and includes several elaborately decorated vases with mythological represent 

ations. A particular feature of his work at this time is the use of added white for the 

visible flesh of women (cf. with no. 366 above).

The vases in this sub-division are decorated with the same sort of subjects as on those 

in (ii), but the treatment is a little heavier, as may be seen from Madrid 11227 (no.

(iv) Later Vases 

The vases in this division come from the latest phase in the painter's career and show 

a marked decline in the quality of the drawing. This is clearly seen in the draped 

woman, enveloped in her himation, who figures on most of the vases in it. She 

appears in two forms—in one she wears a chiton, 'with a row of beads down the 

sleeve, and over it a himation wrapped around her body, to leave only the arm 

exposed (e.g. nos. 454(A), 462, 464-5); the row of small fold-lines on the drapery over 

the leg and beneath the thigh is often clearly indicated (as on nos. 454, 460, 464), 

and this practice looks back to the beginning of the painter's career (cf. nos. 347, 

361), and even to some of the later minor vases from the Asteas-Python workshop 

like no. 2/631. In the second form the woman is completely enveloped by her 

himation, which reveals nothing of the garment beneath it, except for the row of 

beads down the sleeve (as on nos. 459-60). Added white continues to be used for the 

visible flesh (as on nos. 454 and 459), and for lavers or birds (no. 460). The drawing 

has become extremely stereotyped and the subject-matter is highly repetitive. The 

female heads on the lid of Madrid 11442 (no. 460) differ slightly from those on the 

earlier vases and mark the change to the painter's later style in this regard, as on 

Naples 185587 (no. 551).

makes a more positive attribution difficult.

Draped woman with cista and fillet in r. hand, seated on tendril beside a pillar, on which 
she rests her 1. arm. 
In PP this vase was associated with the Painter of Naples 2585 and in PPSupp it was 
placed among the later minor vases of the Asteas-Python workshop; it now seems to me nearer 
to the former and the presence of certain Apulianising elements in the treatment of the 
drapery and flower tend to confirm this.

Anne Weis (loc. cit.) suggests that a possible interpretation of the scene would be 
Herakles about to free Peirithoos or Theseus from imprisonment in Hades, although she 
admits that the bearded man has none of the usual attributes of the hero.

In LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 237, reference was made to two vases then on the Bern market, 

which looked comparable to those of the Ivy-leaf Group, especially Naples 1993. 

They were said to have come from the same tomb as the bottle no. 636 below, and I 

should now incline to place all of them in the present group, since the connection 

between the draped woman on Paestum 5188 and those on the three Bern vases in 

particularly close. The drawing of the face and the hair, the rendering of the 

drapery, with the white stripe down the side, the treatment of the palmettes with 

white outlines and dots on the leaves, and the bunches of grapes on nos. 631 and 634 

are so alike that it seems impossible to keep these vases apart. The Apulian 

background is very evident in the 'xylophone' on no. 635, the flower on no. 634; the 

ivy-leaf on no. 635 links it with the Ivy-leaf Group, but they now seem to me better 

placed here. The seated woman on the bottle is close to the one on no. 638.

*645 Paestum 27092, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 86. Ht. 41. Lid missing. PLATE 227 c, d 
(a) Toilet scene—two nude women at a laver; above, Eros with fan flying to 1., (o) draped 
woman running to r., with bunch of grapes in r. hand and patera in 1. 

This, too, shows a laver scene, but here the two nude women are standing, one 

on each side of the laver, above which flies a rather plump little Eros, holding up a 

fan; on either side of it is the typical piece of folded drapery with the open box in the 

top left-hand corner above. The reverse takes us back to the running women on the 

vases in the Group of Paestum 5188—again the Apulian background is very clear, 

not only in the pose and drapery of the woman, but also in the long-haired patera 

she holds in one hand, and the black-dotted bunch of grapes in the other. 
Slightly later works, but containing the stock figures from the preceding vases, 

are the two following badly battered lebetes gamikoi:

folded drapery above, and is close in style to the preceding fragment, if not from the same

The two following vases, which come from the same tomb as no. 643, represent, 

like that vase, a slightly later phase in the painter's work.

The skyphoid pyxis is a vase of some stylistic interest and, unlike some of the 

others, especially those in (ii), is comparatively well preserved. The scene on the 

obverse is adapted from that on the lebes gamikos 27092 (no. 645) and shows the 

same two women, just a shade fatter, by the laver with the two pieces of folded

(ii) With 'melon-slice' hair 

A few of the later Apulianising vases show female heads with hair in the so-called 

'melon-slice' style, in which it appears as a series of strands pulled taut from the 

forehead to the bunch of hair at the back,6 a fashion which is found in sculpture from 

the later fifth century B.C. but achieves its greatest popularity in the second half of 

the fourth century and later. The bottle from the Paestan Heraion (no. 701) gives an 

excellent example of this fashion, which appears both on the small head on the 

shoulder of the obverse and on the larger head on the reverse, where it is flanked by 

spiralling scrolls and palmettes. In a rather cruder form it will also be found on the 

lid of the Madrid skyphoid pyxis (no. 703) and on several small fragments from the 

agora at Paestum.

THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM 
(b) Fragments from the Agora 

Plates 

705/1 Paestum E 65 III, from the Agora. 7-5 x 8 cm. 
P-P II, p. 99, no. 69, fig. 74. 
Part of the head of a woman, with 'melon-slice' hair, in the tondo; there is a surrounding 
border of rosettes and tendrils with wave-pattern on the edge. 

705/2 Paestum E 54/65, from the Agora. 17 x 10 cm. 
P-P II, p. 100, no. 72, fig. 75. 
Eros with fillet and alabastron flying above nude woman, with 'melon-slice' hair, and 
outstretched arms; to 1., folded drapery above cista. 
Part of a wing in the outer border. 
Looks to go closely with Paestum 48432; cf. also the vases from Spinazzo. 
Frr. E 64/65 III give part of the border, with birds, palmette, and ivy. 

705/3 Paestum E 65 II, from the Agora. 7-1 x 9-6 cm. 
P-P II, p. 98, no. 62, fig. 75. 
The tondo was bordered with an ivy-pattern; on a plaque supporting the plate is a 
female head between spirals, with 'melon-slice' hair. 

705/4 Paestum 59 II, from the Agora. 6-7 x 6-1 cm. 
P-P II, p. 100, no. 71, fig. 75.

705/5 Paestum 58 I, from the Agora. Diam. 8. 
P-P II, p. 100, no. 74, fig. 75. 
Female head, with 'melon-slice' hair. 

Lekanis 

705/6 Paestum, from the Agora. 8-6 x 4-7 cm. 
P-P II, p. 99, no. 70, fig. 75. 
Back part of female head, with 'melon-slice' hair. 

Other fragments from the same site, which do not show female heads, but are 

otherwise comparable in style, are: 

E 41 II—hand holding up a tambourine, nude youth with branch (cf. with E 64/5 
above). 
E 60/66—part of nude woman by laver. 
E 70 II and 72—fragments of a large plate or dish, with added red: piece of drapery; part 
of a draped figure with one leg clearly visible beneath the drapery and part of a wing to r. The 
fold-lines are very thick. 

Perhaps this is the best place in which to consider a rather unusual plate; it was 

found with no accompanying r.f. vases, which might have served to give it some sort 

of context.

*706 Paestum 6193, from C. Andriuolo-Laghetto (1955), T. 95. Diam. 15-5. PLATE235e 
FA 10, 1955, p. 214, no. 2592, fig. 66. 
Female head to 1., with inscription CATQN painted on the neck. 

The head is a little reminiscent of those which appeared on two cups (nos. 

2/915-6 above; PI. 143 j and k), which were placed at the end of section 4 in 

Chapter IX and noted as near in style to some of the work of the Painter ofNaples 

2585. On this plate the hair, which is not caught up in any form of head-dress, 

appears as a black mass on top of the head, enlivened by a row of white beads 

immediately above the brow, a white line bordered by strokes in the centre, and a
