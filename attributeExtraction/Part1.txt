The following vase, formerly in Dorpat and known to me only from the illustration 
in the catalogue of Malmberg and Felsberg (no. 109, pi. 7, 1), looks as if it might also 
be by the Dirce Painter, in view of the similarity of the pattern-work, and the 
treatment of the Greek warrior, but without seeing its reverse I hesitate on a specific 
attribution:

(ii) 
In PP and PPSupp the vases in this division were attributed either to the Dirce 
Painter himself (nos. 18 and 22) or to his followers, and among their works were 
listed many vases which were later (LCS, pp. 213-16; Suppl. Ill, pp. 107-10) placed 
in or near the Prado/Fienga Group. Several of the vases listed below (e.g. nos. 
13-20) were attributed in Suppl. Ill to the Painter of Naples 2074, though it was 
pointed out that his work was extremely close to that of the Dirce Painter. Since then 
a few new vases, which seem certainly to be by the former's hand (nos. 24—6), have 
come to light and these enable us now to draw a better distinction between the work 
of the two painters, though without excluding the possibility that they are identical. 
I should now incline to see the vases in this division as the work of the Dirce Painter, 
and as marking the transition from what we may call his 'Sicilian' style to that of his 
later vases, which may well have been made in Campania. 
There are many points of close resemblance between the vases in this and in the 
preceding division, as may be seen from a comparison between the seated women 
with a dot-stripe bordered cloak over their legs (cf. nos. 3-5, 7-8 (reverses), 9-10 
with nos. 13, 18-22), the standing draped woman with a himation over her tunic 
(cf. nos. 3-4, reverse of 5, with the reverses of nos. 13-15), or simply wearing a peplos 
(cf. nos. 5) (reverse to r.), 7 (reverse to 1.) with nos. 13 (reverse to 1.), 15-16 (reverses 
to 1.), 17 (reverse to r.) and 18); the adjuncts and filling ornaments (e.g. the trees on 
nos. 2, 4, 7, 15; the fillets held by the women on nos. 3 (reverse), 5 (reverse), 10 
(reverse), 13-14 (reverses), 16 (reverse) and 22; the thyrsus heads with their A 
pattern and white dots; the dish with reverse wave decoration on nos. 8, 13 and 22; 
the palmette-scrolls on nos. 1 (reverse), 8, 13; the pattern-work, which very 
frequently consists of meanders with saltire squares. 
There are, however, certain points of difference—on the kraters in this division 
only sal tires accompany the meanders, which on nos. 14, 17-19 are stopt; all the 
reverses show static scenes; a white stephane with small rays comes into fashion for 
women (e.g. nos. 13, 14, 16-19, 22) in contrast to the plain bandeau preferred in (i); 
naked or half-draped women make a more frequent appearance, with rounded 
breasts and clearly defined nipples (e.g. nos. 14 and 17). The mythological subjects, 
which added to the interest of the vases in (i), disappear almost completely except on 
no. 15, which seems best placed here in view of the similarity between its reverse and 
those of nos. 13 and 14, though on them the drawing is more precise. In general, 
women tend to have rather small mouths, with lips fairly tightly compressed (e.g. 
nos. 13-14, 16, 18, 22). Greater use is also made of added white to indicate rising 
ground (nos. 14—19). On the whole, however, the differences seem less significant 
than the similarities, and could well be accounted for by the normal developments 
taking place in the painter's style.

(iii) The Painter of Naples 2074 
Although the vases in this division have much in common with those in the two 
preceding ones, there are some significant points of difference, especially in the 
drapery of the women and in the pattern-work on the bell-kraters. The side-scrolls 
springing out from the fan-palmettes below the handles now assume a more definite 
form (Fig. 3, I above), which reappears with some modifications on the vases in the 
Group of Louvre K240; a large palmette leaf rises up from the base of the fan to curl 
inwards at the handle-join, with a spiral scroll about two-thirds the way up the stem, 
above which is a diamond floral, a flower (on the obverse of no. 25), or a single leaf, 
and below a half palmette-fan (cf. nos. 23-6). This represents a slight modification of 
the patterns on the bell-kraters by the Dirce Painter, in which the leaf on the side-
scroll is of a more sickle-like shape. Further, all four bell-kraters have a band of stopt 
meanders below the pictures, without saltire or chequered squares. A white-studded 
girdle comes into more general use with the peplos (e.g. on nos. 23-6, 28, 31-32). It 
is interesting to compare the youths on the reverse of no. 23 with those on nos. 4 and 
6, where the stance is very different, as is the actual draping of the himatia. The 
continued use of the dot-stripe border, the treatment of the young satyr, the presence 
of the seated draped woman, and the peplos with the rather stiff-looking overfall, 
however, all indicate the close association with the work of the Dirce Painter. 
Originally two other bell-kraters, Louvre K241  and S. Agata 66, were 
associated with the Painter of Naples 2074, but these have now been transferred to 
the Group of Louvre K 240, which seems to follow on almost directly from this 
painter's work and to mark the transition to the true Paestan style. They are dealt 
with in Chapter III.

Neck: [a) and [b) frontal owl, between olive branches. 
This vase, of particular interest for its Albanian provenience, is connected, both 
by its pattern-work and its treatment of the two subjects represented, with the works 
of the painters listed in divisions (i) and (ii) above. The picture on the obverse is 
framed between bands of chevron-pattern (cf. the Kropatschek oenochoe, no. 40 
below; also the early Paestan neck-amphora, Geneva HR 26 = no. 2/1), and on the 
reverse the scrolls flanking the picture have a diamond-shaped floral above a spiral, 
like those on nos. 23-6 above. The saltire squares which accompany the meanders 
find many parallels on other vases in the Dirce Group, and the small tree on the 
obverse is comparable to those on nos. 2, 3, and 7. The treatment of the reverse, and 
especially of the seated woman with the mirror, recalls nos. 5, 8 (reverse), 16, 20 and 
22, and we may also note the wave-pattern on the inner rim of the shield, as on nos. 7 
and 13. It is difficult to determine whether the vase is an import or a local imitation; 
if the former, it would have been more likely to come from Campania, like the pelike 
by the Eros and Hare Painter (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 104, no. 100), and this may well 
have been the case, since the neck-amphora is a popular shape in that fabric and 
some at least of the vases by the Painter of Naples 2074 must have been made there.

Dr. Marie-Louise Bernhard in the text to the CVA (p. 17) assigns this vase to the fabric of 
Paestum; it certainly has stylistic affinities with some of the earlier vases in Chapter IV, but 
seems better placed here, since the floral is closer to those on nos. 25 and 33; the palmette 
scroll also finds a parallel on no. 36, as does the young satyr. 
2. THE PRADO/FIENGA GROUP 
Recent finds from Lipari (nos. 44—6 below) show that the Prado and the Fienga 
Painters (LCS, pp. 212-15; Suppl. I, p. 40; II, p. 135; III, pp. 107-10), who were 
merely included with the followers of the Dirce Painter in PP and PPSupp, but 
separately identified in LCS, should be united as a single painter. The stylistic 
connection between the vases previously attributed to the two painters is so close, 
especially in regard to the figures on the reverses, that they must be the work of the 
same hand. As with the vases of the Dirce Group, the proveniences are mixed; of 
those by the Prado/Fienga Painter himself nine certainly come from Sicily and, while 
none has an established Campanian provenience, it is likely that at least four (nos. 
42, 50, 51 and 53) come from that area. Of the vases in the Group of Louvre K 236, 
none has a Sicilian provenience, two were found in Locri, one in Nola, and one (no. 
69) is said to come from Viterbo. It looks again as if at least one of the painters in this 
Group—probably the Painter of Louvre K 236—established a workshop in Cam 
pania, since his work had a very strong influence upon early Campanian and also on 
Paestan; other artists may well have remained in Sicily since the larger vases 
associated with the Lentini-Manfria Group, like those by the Painter of the Lugano 
Pyxis, and in the Adrastos, Maron and Gibil Gabib Groups (LCS, Suppl. Ill, pp. 
273-7) also reflect the influence of the Prado/Fienga Group. One point is worth 
making here, that on the vases of the Sicilian followers we seldom find dot-stripe 
borders to the drapery, while in Campania and especially at Paestum they are in 
regular use. 
(i) The Prado/Fienga Painter 
The chief stylistic characteristics of this painter are set out in LCS, p. 214, but we 
may note, in particular, that: 
(a) the composition of the main pictures is more elaborate, often with four or 
five figures disposed on different levels, sometimes in active movement; the reverses 
regularly represent two draped figures, usually wrapped in a himation, at first with a 
plain border, later with a dot-stripe. Youths usually wear a white head-band or 
chaplet, women a saccos or a white radiate stephane. 
(b) the faces tend to look rather heavier, especially the chin, which is very 
strongly emphasised on the later vases and those associated with Louvre K 236. 
(c) kraters regularly have chequers or crossed squares with the meanders; the 
squares generally have a saltire cross, either with a large solid black triangle in the 
four divisions (e.g. nos. 42, 45-7), or two hollow triangles, one inside the other (nos. 
43^1, 48); on some vases (nos. 49, 50, 58) the meander assumes a flatter, rectangular 
form, which is highly individual; wave-pattern is used on the bell-kraters nos. 51 and 
53. 
(d) a new type of floral appears on the side-scrolls, consisting of a saucer-shaped 
flower with a large cluster of dots in the centre (e.g. on nos. 50-1, 53, 55-7). 
(e)'there is a marked preference for Dionysiac subjects, nearly all the vases 
depicting maenads and satyrs, but not the god himself; thyrsi, tambourines, panther-
skins and ivy wreaths appear with great frequency.

The bell-krater no. 48 serves as an excellent link between these two divisions of the 
painter's work. The dotted flower accompanying the side-palmettes is similar to 
those on nos. 46-7 (cf. also the crescent-shaped leaf, which is like those on nos. 8 and 
10 above); the lightly-sprung palmette leaves below it are repeated on nos. 49 and 
51. The figures on the obverse are neatly drawn and comparable to those on Lipari 
6814 (no. 46); the tambourine in the top right corner of the obverse of no. 49 finds a 
parallel in those on the reverse of the Fienga krater (no. 50) and on nos. 52 and 58.

The vases in this sub-division, while almost certainly the work of the painter himself, 
lead on to those in the Group of Louvre K 236. 
The skyphoid pyxis in Ragusa (no. 58) provides a good connecting link and is of 
particular interest, both for its shape and for its decoration. The two skyphoid 
pyxides (nos. 55-6) in sub-division (b) are similar in shape, but have figured scenes 
on the lid, as against an extremely well-drawn vine-wreath, with pendant bunches of 
black grapes on no. 58. Here the side palmettes are also more elaborate, and the rims 
of both the bowl and the lid are decorated with egg-pattern instead of dicing (double 
rows of dots). However, the characteristic flat rectangular meanders (cf. nos. 49-50) 
and the no less typical tambourine (cf. nos. 49, 50, 52) and kalathos (cf. nos. 45, 47), 
as well as the rendering of the drapery and the drawing of the bearded silen show the 
vase to be by the painter's own hand. We should, however, note that on the vases 
below the pupil of the eye tends to be rather larger and the chin a little heavier. 
The bell-like flowers which flank the fan-palmette below the handles find an 
interesting parallel on a mosaic from Eretria,2 which has been dated in the first third 
of the fourth century B.C. They reappear in a slightly different form on Syracuse 
47039 and the Lugano skyphoid pyxis (see Trendall, NAC9,  1980, p. 98 and fig. 4 A). 
The side-scrolls with palmette-fans above and below the spirals look forward to Type 
III of Early Paestan.

(ii) The Painter of Louvre K236 
As was pointed out in LCS (p. 216), there is very little to distinguish this painter from 
the Prado/Fienga Painter. However, the appearance of some new vases by his hand, 
especially the Geddes krater (no. 63) and the transference to him of Hope 260 (now 
Canberra 83.01) enable us to see his work in somewhat greater detail than was 
previously possible and to define more clearly some of the ways in which it diverges 
from that of the Prado/Fienga Painter. It is also worth noting that, while two of the 
vases (nos. 65 and 67) come from Locri, none has a definite Sicilian provenience, and 
one (no. 68) is known to have been found in Nola; it is also probable that the vases 
formerly in the Hope and Palagi collections (nos. 64, 70-1) came from Campania 
rather than from further south. 
Louvre K236 and the Geddes krater go very closely together in shape, 
composition, style and pattern-work and provide an excellent basis for the study of 
this painter's work. Both their obverses have four-figure compositions, each with two 
2Ducrey and Metzger, Ant.Welt 10.1, 1979, p. 4, fig. 4; AntK22, 1979, pi. 1,2 and pi. 2,4. 
groups of two figures, one of which is a seated woman, with the usual dot-stripe 
bordered drapery over her legs; the second figure in each group varies, a woman 
bending forward over her raised right foot, or standing with one arm akimbo and a 
tambourine held up in her right hand, an Eros with a phiale, a bearded silen 
bending forward with an ivy-branch in his right hand. The two reverses are very 
similar, on no. 62 a woman with a himation over her tunic, falling down over her left 
shoulder and passing under her right arm, which is stretched out, a white egg held in 
the palm of her hand, faces a woman draped in much the same manner, except for 
her himation which runs transversely across her body, and holding out a phiale in 
her right hand; on the other vase (no. 63) the figure to left is a youth, but otherwise 
the scene is much the same, with a palmette scroll between the two figures and a 
phiale in the field above. The draping of the himation of the left-hand figure, over 
the shoulder with the visible edges meeting at a right-angle (cf. with no. 54 by the 
Prado/Fienga Painter), and the 'tail-like' fall of the lower corner of the himation of 
the one on the right seem typical of this painter. The boldly-drawn, clear fold-lines of 
the women's drapery, especially across the chest and over the legs, are also 
characteristic and differ slightly from those on the drapery of the Prado/Fienga 
Painter. The white-studded girdle is also popular, as is a dotted kekryphalos or saccos 
with a radiate stephane. The presence of a tambourine, decked with white ribbons, 
and having a white cross or dotted circle on a black disk in the centre is also very 
common (cf. nos. 62-4, 68, 70-2). 
The Louvre and Geddes kraters enable us to attribute the calyx-krater recently 
acquired by the Classics Department of the Australian National University in 
Canberra (83.01; no. 64) to the same hand. This vase, formerly in the Hope 
collection (Tillyard, no. 260), was at first placed with the followers of the Dirce 
Painter (PP, no. 9) and then (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 100) grouped with Lipari 168 F (no. 
13 above), on the strength of the resemblance of the draped woman on the reverse to 
the corresponding one on that vase. The resemblance is indeed very close, but it is 
still closer to the two on the reverses of nos. 62-3, and the youth finds a better 
parallel in the one on no. 63, especially in the overhang of his himation and the 
rendering of the fold-lines. If we turn to the obverse we will again note the strong 
fold-lines on the drapery of the two women, as well as the characteristic head-dress 
and tambourine. More significant, perhaps, is the drawing of the pupil of their eyes 
as a large black dot, which is more characteristic of this group than of the vases 
associated with the Dirce Painter. The bearded silen with the white ivy-branch is 
also very close to his counterpart on the Geddes krater. The other vases attributed to 
this painter, especially the Louvre skyphos (no. 68), merely repeat figures from the 
larger vases; nos. 70-2 form a very compact group, and it is interesting to note that 
on the three oenochoai (nos. 71-3) the pictures are all framed between reserved 
bands decorated with chevrons or ivy. 
The Painter of Louvre K 236 is of particular importance for his relationship to 
the Painter of the Geneva Orestes in Early Paestan.

(iii) Vases related in style 
The three vases in this division were all considered in LCS and Suppl. Ill as being 
associated with the Prado/Fienga Painter and this seems to be the case, although 
they stand slightly apart from the vases specifically attributed to his hand. All are 
connected by the presence of a seated figure across the lower part of whose body is a 
piece of drapery with a wave-pattern border and embroidered dot-clusters. The bold 
fold-lines, very clear on the drapery of Aphrodite on the Cefalu lebes (no. 75) or of 
the canephoros on the Naples amphora (no. 76), are in the typical manner of the 
Prado/Fienga Painter, as is the bearded silen on the lost vase published by Tischbein 
(no. 74). There can be little doubt that it is in the present context that all three vases 
should find a place. The subjects depicted on nos. 75-6 represent a departure from 
the normal themes on vases by the Prado/Fienga Painter, though Eros appears not 
infrequently in his work (e.g. on nos. 45, 50, 51, 58-9, 62), but the mythological 
scenes on both sides of no. 76 hark back to the Dirce Painter. As yet no very 
convincing interpretation of either has been put forward. The scene on the obverse 
shows a woman, seated in an attitude of dejection, on the stepped basis of an Ionic 
tomb-monument, the shaft of which she grasps with her upraised left hand; to left 
stands a woman with a basket of offerings on her head, a wreath in one hand and an 
alabastron in the other; to right, a white-haired woman, perhaps the old nurse, leans 
forward over her right foot which rests on the top step. The scene, which from the 
gestures and the offerings, must be one of mourning, may be little more than generic, 
though it has much in common with representations of Electra at the tomb of 
Agamemnon, and it may perhaps represent the moment before the arrival of Orestes 
and Pylades, who appear on the Geneva amphora (no. 2/1 below). The reverse 
shows a bearded man, with a stick in his right hand and a phiale in his left, standing 
in front of a woman seated on an altar (or stele) and holding a sceptre in her right 
hand. It distantly reminds me of Aigeus and Themis on Berlin F2538,3 but on the 
amphora the attributes are reversed, since it is the man who holds the phiale and the 
woman the sceptre.

3. THE SIKON AND TUNNY-SELLER PAINTERS 
The work of these two painters is linked by the similarity of the pattern-work, 
especially the florals, which flanks the pictures on their bell-kraters. They belong to 
the borderland between Sicilian, Campanian and Paestan and well illustrate the 
effects of a common Sicilian background upon the two latter fabrics. This is 
particularly clear in the reverses, as may be seen by comparing the reverse of the 
Dublin krater by the Sikon Painter with that of the Orestes amphora in Geneva (no. 
2/1 below), which is early Paestan, or the reverses of the two kraters by the Tunny-
seller Painter with those on the earlier Paestan vases from the Asteas-Python 
workshop. 
(i) The Sikon Painter 
The Sikon Painter was identified in LCS (p. 213) where he was rightly placed near 
the Prado/Fienga Painter. He is probably an early Campanian artist, but should be 
considered here for the parallels to early Paestan which his vases afford us. Perhaps 
the most remarkable feature of his kraters is his practice of framing the pictures on 
their obverses between vertical reserved bands decorated with wave-pattern and 
with a band of egg-pattern across the top on nos. 77-8 and 80, and a row of dentils 
on no. 79, perhaps intended to convey the suggestion of a building of which the 
vertical 'posts' support, as it were, an architrave. This dentil pattern, in a slightly 
simpler form with black alternating with reserved areas, occurs quite frequently on 
later Sicilian vases, usually just below the pictures, where it sometimes gives the 
effect of a stage-floor supported by posts;4 it reappears in Paestan on the Cadmus and 
Opheltes kraters by Python (nos. 2/241-2 below). The reverses show very clearly the 
strong influence of the Prado/Fienga Group in both the composition and the 
treatment of the drapery; the floral patterns recall those of nos. 48-9 above. They 
also seem to have inspired some of those on early Campanian vases in the Cassandra 
and Parrish Groups. 
The phlyax actor on the former Ruesch krater (no. 77) is inscribed ZIKQN, 
which at least suggests a Sicilian connection, and his costume should be compared 
with that of the phylakes on nos. 99-101 and 105 in Chapter III.

(a) Eros bending forward in front of seated woman, [b) two draped youths, as on no. 82. 
So far only two vases, both bell-kraters, can be assigned to this painter, and of 
these one (no. 83) has vanished from sight and is known to me only from the 
illustrations in the Sale Catalogue. There can be little doubt, however, that the two 
vases go closely together—they are almost identical in shape and pattern-work, with 
florals very similar to those on nos. 79-80 above; the wave-pattern below the 
pictures, already noted on no. 80 is to become standard on Paestan bell-kraters and 
the two youths on the reverses also show affinities with those of that fabric. 
The scene on no. 82 has been the subject of much discussion; it finds an 
interesting parallel on a Lucanian bell-krater by the Brooklyn-Budapest Painter in a 
private collection in Munich (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 69, no. BB 32, where bibliography), 
and the rendering of the two fish recalls that on some of the early Sicilian fish-plates 
(cf. Claude Bjork in Medelhavsmuseet Bulletin 19, 1984, pp. 63 ff, figs. 2-A and 7-9), 
which are discussed in detail in Greek Red-figured Fish-plates (pp. 59-67). 
On the present evidence it is very difficult to determine where these two vases 
were made, even though one of them has an assured Sicilian provenience. They are 
related to Sicilian, Campanian and Paestan, and should certainly find a place in any 
study of the background to the two latter fabrics. In view of their connections with 
the work of the Sikon Painter, I should at present incline to think of them as more 
likely to be Campanian. 
The Eros and Hare and Revel Painters have not been discussed in this chapter 
since both seem Campanian and, while they reflect the influences of some of the 
painters discussed above, they have less connection with the origins of Paestan. 
We have now passed in review some 80 vases which fall, on broad stylistic 
principles, into two fairly homogeneous groups, capable of further sub-division 
according to the individual characteristics of the various artists represented. A 
substantial proportion of these vases has an assured Sicilian provenience and they 
must be regarded as of local manufacture. Others come from various sites in 
Calabria and Campania, and one at least from Paestum (no. 26), and this suggests a 
possible migration of artists from Sicily to those areas, either in transit or to take up 
permanent abode. In any case the groups of vases we have just considered provide 
the background against which the local fabrics of Campania and Paestum came into 
existence during the second quarter of the fourth century B.C. and flourished there 
during the rest of that century, each developing its own particular characteristics 
with the progress of time, but never entirely losing sight of their original source of 
inspiration. Pottery continued to be made in Sicily, and it is interesting to compare 
those vases produced locally by followers of the Dirce and Prado/Fienga Painters, 
like the Painter of the Agrigento Pyxis (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 112), in the period 
between c. 370 and 360 B.C., when the mainland fabrics come into being, or by the 
slightly later artists, like the Painter of the Lugano Pyxis or those associated with the 
Adrastos, Maron and Gibil Gabib Groups (op. cit., pp. 274—7), with those after 
c. 340 B.C., when a substantial revival of the Sicilian pottery industry took place 
following the victories of Timoleon. Many significant differences between Sicilian 
after c. 360 B.C. and Paestan may be observed, both in the choice and treatment of 
shapes (e.g. the calyx-krater and the skyphoid pyxis) and in the pattern-work and 
the rendering of the drapery (plain black borders rather than dot-stripe; the 
continuing use of the white-studded girdle), as well as in the subject-matter where 
themes with a theatrical association (both tragic and comic) appear on a higher 
proportion of the vases. 
As has already been pointed out, it was the second generation of Sicilian vase-
painters whose work provided the models for early Campanian and Paestan, with 
the result that these two fabrics reflect the influence of Attic to a much lesser extent 
than do Lucanian and Apulian, which had begun half a century earlier, before the 
substantial decline in Attic imports which was one of the consequences of the 
Peloponnesian War. Paestan, perhaps more than Campanian, remained faithful to 
the traditions it had inherited from Sicilian, in shapes, subject-matter, composition 
and pattern-work. 
PAESTAN 
The preceding chapter listed a number of vases, many of which were found in Sicily 
and had probably been made there. These vases provide the background, in regard 
to shape, decorative patterns and subject-matter, to the rise and development of the 
red-figure fabrics of Campania and Paestum. It seems highly likely that at least some 
of the vases there discussed were actually made in Campania; in any case they lead 
directly into the earliest schools of Campanian red-figure, the products of which run 
at first along lines closely parallel to those of early Paestan. The present chapter deals 
with the main groups of vases, also of probable Sicilian origin, which seem to lead 
directly to Paestan; indeed, several of them (nos. 85-7, 94—5, 98-100, 102-3) had 
already been assigned to that fabric in PP, PPSupp and PAdd. 
1. THE SCOGLITTI PAINTER 
This artist was identified in LCS, pp. 216-7, where nos. 84, 86 and 87 were ascribed 
to his hand; in PPSupp, nos. 85-7 had already been grouped with Early Paestan and 
placed in the section devoted to the 'Followers of the Dirce Painter'. That the four 
vases (nos. 84—7) listed below are the work of a single painter seems almost certain 
from various repeated features which link them all together. Among these we may 
note: 
(i) the woman wearing a peplos, with beaded girdle at the waist, double vertical 
stripe down the centre, and dot-stripe border either to the peplos or the overfall, or 
to both (nos. 84, 86-7); 
(ii) the draped youths to the left on the reverses of nos. 85 and 86; they are 
almost identical, with the same stance, the same overhang of the himation on the 
right shoulder, and the same dot-stripe border; note also the presence of small hook 
like marks on the himatia of both youths; these appear again on the drapery of the 
youths on the reverse of no. 84 which also has dot-stripe borders; 
(iii) the repetition of a small palmette scroll, with a diamond floral, and an 
inward-curving palmette-leaf below the spiral. This is seen to right of the obverse on 
no. 84, below the handles on no. 85, to left of the obverse of no. 86, and upside-down 
on the top left of the obverse of no. 87. On nos. 85-6 the meanders, which are stopt, 
are accompanied by saltire squares with solid black triangles in the intersections, on 
no. 84 with hollow triangles instead. 
As we shall see, the draped youths on nos. 85 and 86 have close affinities with 
those on early Paestan, where also parallels to the running women on nos. 87 and 88 
will be found; the beaded bandeau worn by the woman on no. 87 is also common in 
Paestan. 
The obverse of Syracuse 51282 (no. 85) has been extensively restored and a 
good deal of the figure of Dionysos has been repainted.

The two following vases are comparable in style to the work of the Scoglitti 
Painter, but hardly seem to be by his own hand. In LCS, Suppl. Ill (p. 196) the bell-
krater in Ragusa was associated with Vienna 687 (LCS, pp. 211-2, pi. 83, 3), on the 
strength of the similarity between the fan-palmettes below the handles and their 
side-scrolls with dotted flowers; there is indeed a good deal of resemblance, but it is 
probably little more than generic, and the drawing of the two women on the obverse, 
as well as that of the two figures on the reverse, and especially of their drapery, with 
its dot-stripe borders, looks to be nearer to the work of the Scoglitti Painter.

2. THE GROUP OF LOUVRE K 240 
This is a most interesting and important group of vases which provides a direct link 
between Sicilian and the first truly Paestan vases from the workshop of Asteas.1 
Many of the vases have subjects with theatrical associations, depicting comic masks 
in a Dionysiac context or else scenes with phlyax actors. Similar masks appear on 
several Paestan vases either by Asteas himself or from his workshop, as also do the 
female busts looking down from a window, as on Lipari 927 (no. 99), and vases with 
scenes from phlyax plays or showing a single actor, often with Dionysos, are not only 
common in the Asteas-Python workshop but amongst the best and liveliest of all its 
products. It would appear that the vases of this group served as their models. It 
should be noted that four of the vases in it were found at Lipari (nos. 90-92 and 99) 
'See my article in NAC 9, 1980, pp. 112-13. 
where the theatre seems to have played an unusually important part in daily life, as 
well as in art, to judge from the great number of terracotta figurines from that site, 
depicting a variety of characters from Greek drama, some from tragedy but mostly 
from comedy. These are discussed in some detail and well illustrated in Bernabo 
Brea's Menandro e il teatro greco nelle terrecotte liparesi, though the dates there given for 
many of the r.f. vases seem to me to be rather later than their style would indicate 
(see LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 268). Of the other vases in this group, two of those with 
known proveniences come from Sicily (no. 102 from Gela and 103 from Syracuse); of 
the next, two come from mainland sites (no. 95 from S. Agata and no. 100 from 
Taranto), and this is also probably true of nos. 94, 96 and 98. It is, therefore, very 
difficult to determine whether these vases were made in Sicily and exported to the 
mainland, or actually made there. In the light of the new evidence from Lipari, it is 
not unreasonable to think that nos. 90-93 are of Sicilian origin, and probably nos. 
99, 102 and 103 also, but it would not surprise me if some at least of the others 
(especially nos. 94-5 and 98) were of mainland manufacture, especially as several 
undoubtedly Paestan vases come from S. Agata.2 It is perhaps safest, in view of the 
gaps in our knowledge, to regard all these vases as the immediate antecedents of 
Paestan, rather than as true Paestan, although in PP and PPSupp some of them (e.g. 
nos. 94-5, 98-100, 102-3) were in fact so classed. 
(i) Forerunner 
We may begin with a vase recently found in Lipari which provides a connecting link 
between some of the vases of Sicilian origin discussed in Chapter II and those in 
division (ii) below. 
Calyx-krater 

*90  Lipari 11807, from T. 1675 A. Ht. 40-5, diam. 41-9.  PLATE 10 c, d 
MTL, p. 267, fig. 444. 
(a) Maenad and Dionysos, who holds a lyre and thyrsus, young satyr fluting, maenad 
with branch, [b) bearded silen with thyrsus pursuing maenad with thyrsus and tambourine. 
In shape this calyx-krater is close to Madrid 32653 by the Prado/Fienga Painter 
(no. 42); the stem is comparatively tall and about a third of the way up from the foot 
is decorated with a reserved stripe above a black band in relief; it runs into the foot in 
a sweeping curve (cf. also no. 45), unlike most of the other calyx-kraters (e.g. nos. 44, 
62^) where the foot is lighter and comparatively flat and the relief band joins it to 
the stem. The chequer pattern accompanying the meanders is also common on vases 
of the Prado/Fienga Group (e.g. nos. 42-5, 62-3), as are the small white plants and 
dot-clusters beside the white ground-lines (e.g. nos. 44—5, 48-9, 62-3). The ivy-
wreaths worn by all the figures on this vase, and the ivy branch carried by the 
maenad to left on the obverse, find good parallels on nos. 45, 50, 54, 56, 63^-, the 
swirling drapery of the three maenads, on nos. 47-8 and especially on nos. 77-8 by 
the Sikon Painter, and the bearded satyr is very similar to those which appear 
frequently on the vases in that group. The connection, therefore, with the vases in 
the Prado/Fienga Group seems fairly clear, and it is no less so with those in division 
(ii), where again we shall find the white ground-line with dot-clusters and small 
2E.g. two vases signed by Asteas (Naples 3226 and Berlin F3044); one by Python, B.M. F 149; 
two others attributed to Python, Naples 2846 and Louvre N3157; one by the Boston Orestes Painter 
(B.M. F154). 
plants (nos. 91, 98), the ivy-wreaths and branches (nos. 91, 93, 95, 98), the swirling 
drapery (nos. 95-8), the running maenad with the overfall bordered by a dot-stripe 
(reverses of nos. 95-7). 
(ii) The Painter of Louvre K240 
The Painter of Louvre K 240 is an artist of considerable interest and importance, 
whose work marks the transition from Sicilian to Paestan and leads directly on to 
that of Asteas. It falls into two groups, one containing vases with Dionysiac or 
related scenes, the other with representations of phlyakes. 
(a)

phlyax mask (B), bending forward in front of seated Dionysos, with drapery over his lower 
limbs, holding a kantharos in his r. hand and a thyrsus, with suspended bell at top, in his 1.; 
beside him is a table with four eggs on it, and behind him a maenad, wearing a loin-cloth, and 
holding an egg in her outstretched r. hand and a flute in her 1., slightly above to r. is a seated 
bearded silen with phiale in 1. and egg in r. Above in the centre hangs a white female mask 
(SS), and to r. an ivy trail; below to 1. a calyx-krater, [b) draped woman, holding thyrsus in 1., 
standing in front of young satyr bending forward with an open wreath held in both hands, 
between them, a small palmette. 

*92  Lipari 9558, from T. 921. Ht. 38-5.  PLATE 11 c, d 
MTL, fig. 442. 
(a) Bearded silen approaching sleeping maenad between to 1., Pan with raised hands in a 
gesture of surprise, and to r. papposilen shading his eyes (6:ITOCTKOTTEUCOV); above to r., bust of 
maenad with outflung arms; below, small palmette and pointed amphora on its side, [b) nude 
youth with wreath in r. hand, stick and wreath in 1., draped woman with fillet and 
tambourine. 
These two vases almost form a matching pair in shape and decoration. Here the 
stem is shorter than on no. 90; the relief band, with a reserved stripe on either side of 
it, is placed where the stem joins the foot; the handle-zone again decorated with stopt 
meanders and a chequered square. Of particular interest are the two comic masks, 
one of the slave (type B — OMC3,  p. 15), the other, suspended above, probably that 
of the young woman (type SS = OMC,3  p. 22), which reappears on Lipari 927 
(no. 99) and on vases by Asteas (cf. also the masks on Louvre K240). A further 
connection with the work of Asteas is to be seen in the figure of Dionysos (cf. also 
Lipari 927); the treatment of the face and the head, with an ivy-wreath around it 
and an intertwined red fillet, decorated with white dots, which falls down onto his 
shoulders is very much in the manner of Asteas, as is also the drapery, with its dot-
stripe border and embroidered stars or circles. Comparable heads will also be seen 
on nos. 94—5, 100-101, as well as on several early Paestan vases (e.g. nos. 2/8-9, 
24—6). The reverse, however, with the satyr bending forward beisde a standing 
maenad, finds better parallels in Sicilian, especially on the reverses of Syracuse 
47039 and the calyx-krater from Selinunte (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 274, nos. 46 and 46 a). 
The second krater (no. 92) shows a silen coming up to a sleeping woman, her r. 
hand flung up around her head in the typical way in which sleepers are depicted in 
Greek art (see P. J. Connor in AA, 1984, pp. 387-94); she is not Ariadne, but a 
maenad, since she wears a fawn-skin and rests against a tambourine. The half-length 
THE TRANSITION FROM SICILIAN TO PAESTAN 
maenad who appears with outstretched arms, as if looking down on the scene partly 
concealed by rising round, is destined to become a popular figure in Paestan; note 
also the rows of white buttons down the short sleeves of her chiton, since they also 
will reappear frequently. The white-haired and bearded silen, wearing a red head 
band, links this vase with nos. 94 and 95, as also does the white ivy-wreath above the 
picture. Here the figures on the reverse are static, a standing youth with a wreath in 
each hand and a tall stick in the left, a draped woman, wearing peplos with overfall, 
but without dot-stripe borders, holding a looped fillet in one hand and a tambourine 
in the other; down the centre of her peplos runs a double black stripe, a decorative 
element which we shall see frequently in Paestan. 
A  few fragments, probably also from a calyx-krater, found in the Lipari

Louvre K240 (no. 94) provides a good connecting link with the two calyx-
kraters (nos. 91-2), repeating several of the features (comic mask, white-haired silen, 
suspended ivy-wreath, etc.) that we had noted on them. Here, however, the masks 
look to be those of the hetaira (XA, with side hair; XB, with hair enclosed =  OMC3, 
p. 24). The double dot-stripe running down the chiton of the fluting maenad, and 
the beaded head-band of the standing woman on the reverse are both very much in 
the Paestan fashion. The side-scrolls springing out from the base of the palmette-fan 
below the handles are in general form like those of Type I, but now a single drop-leaf 
takes the place of the small fan beneath the spiral on the stem (Type II; as also on 
nos. 95, 97 and 98) and there is a diamond floral above it. The running maenads 
with profile heads and almost frontal bodies on the reverses of nos. 95 and 98 should 
be compared with the corresponding figure on no. 90. All wear a peplos with a dot-
stripe border to the overfall and lower hem, and a white-beaded girdle. Nos. 96 and 
97 go closely together in the treatment of their obverses; the youth with the lyre finds 
a counterpart in Dionysos on no. 90. The Eros on the back of the papposilen on 
Louvre K 241 reappears on the phlyax krater no. 101; the little bell on the thyrsus of 
Dionysos on no. 97 is also found on no. 98 and again on an early Paestan bell-krater 
in Melbourne (no. 2/24). The reverse is of more than usual interest for this painter— 
it shows a nude youth between a half-draped youth (type Bv) and a draped youth 
(type A2 r, holding wreath); it is extremely close to early Paestan in its treatment of 
the two draped youths, and gives one pause to reflect whether the transition to that 
fabric has not now been made. The work of the Painter of Louvre K240 follows a 
very coherent pattern, extremely like that found on the early vases from the 
workshop of Asteas. 
(*) 
The vases in this sub-division all represent scenes associated with the phlyax plays. 
Most of them are already very well-known and have been widely published and do 
not in consequence require treatment in very great detail.

White-haired phlyax (mask L) with crooked stick, part of another figure. 
The phlyakes on these vases fall into two types—that of the old man, with white 
hair and beard (Type L = OMC3,  p. 18), who appears on all six, and that of the 
slave (Type B = OMC3,  p. 15), who appears on nos. 94 and 103. The typical phlyax 
costume consists of a slightly padded jerkin, usually painted red on Paestan vases, 
with patches in a lighter shade of pink for the area around the nipples and the navel, 
and tightly-fitting hose on arms and legs. It might be compared to a suit of tights, to 
which a large phallus has been attached, and in this form simulates the appearance 
of nudity. Over it may be worn a short chiton, usually painted white, and sometimes 
a chlamys over that. The stripe that runs down the legs on the hose worn by the two 
phlyakes on no. 99, to mark the seam, is of interest, since it is particularly 
characteristic of Paestan phlyax costumes, where it generally appears in added 
white.3 On the same vase, the scene is depicted as taking place on a stage, beneath 
the wooden floor of which is a row of white dots, representing the ends of the cross 
beams, and it is supported by a number of posts concealed behind a long curtain-like 
piece of drapery, which has been pinned on to them. The stage setting here 
anticipates that on the phlyax krater in Berlin (F3044; no. 2/125 below) signed by 
Asteas, for which it may well have been the model. 
It will be noted that on the three calyx-kraters (nos. 99-101) Dionysos is also 
present, looking very much as he does on nos. 91 and 95, and that on no. 99 there are 
two figures wearing comic female masks (Type XB and S) looking down from 
windows on the scene taking place below. The picture is framed, in a manner very 
typical of Paestan, by reserved bands with small white capitals at the top to give the 
effect of columns and to emphasise the theatrical setting. The running maenad on 
the reverse should be compared with those on nos. 90, 95-97; for the dotted nipple of 
the silen cf. Canberra 83.01 by the Painter of Louvre K236 (no. 64). The Taranto 
3E.g. nos. 2/19, 26, 33, 45, 64, 125, 176-7, 223, 238, 258, 278, 306. Several others have a black line 
to mark the seam. 
The white stripe appears also on the calyx-krater Glasgow 03.70f from Lipari [PhV2, no. 78), but 
this is Sicilian. A row of white dots (cf. Gela 8255; no. 102) runs down the leg of the phlyax on the 
fragmentary oenochoe Taranto 4658 [PhV2, no. 119; CVA 1, IV Dr, pi. 15,2); this is exceptional. 
krater (no. 100) is close in style, but is ill preserved; the ecstatic maenad is close to the 
one on Louvre K241 (no. 98), the sedate draped woman on the reverse to those on 
nos. 91 and 94. 
The calyx-krater (no. 101) on the New York market strikes a rather different 
note. On the obverse we see the typical Dionysos, a lyre in one hand (cf. nos. 90, 
96-7) and the plectrum in the other, moving rapidly to left over gently undulating 
ground, from which spring up some small plants and flowers; he is followed by an old 
phlyax, waving a flaming torch in each hand, and by a bearded silen, doing his best 
to play the flute, while he carries a small Eros, 'flying angel' on his back (cf. no. 98). 
It is a lively scene, with contrasting expressions on the faces of the three figures. The 
reverse is less exciting; a silen bending forward over his left foot, which rests on a 
rock-pile, admonishes a rather haughty looking maenad, who holds a thyrsus in her 
left hand; she wears a long chiton, with a dot-stripe border at the lower hem, and a 
black stripe down the side. The saltire squares which accompany the meanders are 
the same as those on Louvre K241 (no. 98) and are of the type regularly found on 
the vases of the Dirce Painter and his followers. 
The three fragmentary vases (nos. 102-4) all represent the old phlyax, with 
receding white hair and strongly marked white eyebrows. On nos. 103 and 104 he 
holds a curiously twisted stick, with a curved handle. One would have liked to see 
more of both nos. 102 and 104, since from what remains it is difficult to reconstruct 
the scenes. On the former it would appear that there was a seated figure upon an 
altar, on either side of whom was another figure (only the one to left is preserved, 
and part of the foot of the other); perhaps one of the not infrequent scenes where the 
errant slave seeks refuge from his master. On no. 104 there are traces of a figure 
wearing a Phrygian cap beside the old phlyax; this, as Schauenburg points out 
(Wandlungen, p. 189), raises a number of possibilities, like Paris, Pelops or Orpheus, of 
which the first is perhaps the most likely. 
It is perhaps worth noting that two of these fragments (nos. 103-4) come from 
vases of shapes not found at Paestum—the rhyton and the si tula. The former is most 
exceptional, since this shape is largely confined to Apulian;4 situlae, however, 
though more widely used in Apulian, are found in Campanian (see Schauenburg, 
loc. cit., p. 191, note 2). The chevron framing on no. 104 is repeated on the Geneva 
Orestes amphora (no. 2/1). The appearance of the rhyton lends a little support to the 
suggestion that this vase is more likely to have been made in Sicily than at Paestum. 
(iii) The Herakles and Apollo phlyax krater in Leningrad 
Bell-krater 

*105  Leningrad 1660 (St. 1777). Ht. 32.  PLATE \3e,f 
PP, no. 35, fig. 16; PPSupp, no. 45; PhV2, p. 33, no. 32 (where bibliography); Neverov, 
Kultura, ill. on p. 151; Kurt Galinsky. The Herakles Theme, p. 95, pi. 9, fig. 13. 
(a) Phlyax scene—Herakles threatening Apollo at Delphi, (b) draped woman, holding 
cista, and nude youth with fillet and tambourine. 
This is a remarkable vase and extremely difficult to place. The subject is both 
interesting and amusing and presents few problems in interpretation. Herakles has 
come to Delphi to seek purification from Apollo for the murder of Linus. When 
4See H. Hoffmann, Tarentine Rhyta, pp. 93 ff.; he lists seven rhyta (nos. 523-9 in his catalogue) as 
Lucanian and two as Paestan—Syracuse 29966 and a fragment in the University of Heidelberg, of 
which not enough remains in my opinion to identify it as belonging to that fabric. 
Apollo refused to do this, Herakles seized the Delphic tripod, and the two were 
reconciled only through the intervention of Zeus and Athena, a theme extremely 
popular in Attic vase-painting. In the phlyax version the scene is entirely different. 
Herakles stands on a three-legged table, perhaps intended as a parody of the tripod, 
and holds out a dish of cakes in one hand to Apollo, who has fled to the roof of the 
temple, still holding his bow and laurel-branch. In his other hand Herakles has his 
knotty club, ready to deal a blow to Apollo should he venture to take one of the cakes 
and thus probably cause him to fall into the louterion which stands immediately 
beneath him. To right is a third phlyax, presumably Iolaos, who holds up his right 
hand and seems to be shouting at Apollo. In the top left-hand corner hangs the mask 
of a white-haired and bearded phlyax (type L), and above Herakles is a wreath in 
added white to fill the otherwise empty space. 
The attribution of the vase, however, raises difficult problems. Zahn (FR iii, 
p. 191) assigned the vase to Asteas, but to his later period on the ground that the 
palmettes beside the handles were similar to those on the Apulianising volute-krater 
in Naples representing Jason and the golden fleece (3248; below no. 3/630). There is 
in fact only a very slight resemblance, the side-palmettes on the Leningrad krater 
being much closer to those on nos. 33, 39 and 41 above, which at least suggests a 
Sicilian connection. In PP and PPSupp the vase was also assigned to Asteas, but I 
now believe that the reverse rules out such an attribution, since there is no parallel to 
it on any of that painter's other vases. It shows a standing woman, wearing a chiton 
over which a himation is wrapped, and a nude youth facing her, with a white fillet in 
his right hand and a small tambourine in his left. Such a scene is completely out of 
keeping with any of the known reverses of Asteas, even that of the Oxford phlyax 
skyphos (1945.43; below, no. 2/33), which is itself exceptional. Nor are there any 
convincing parallels for it on the reverses of the phlyax vases considered above. On 
the other hand, the phlyax scene on the obverse is in the typical Sicilian-Paestan 
manner. We have already seen on nos. 99, 102-4 above, the characteristic use of a 
red padded jerkin, over which a short tunic, often in added white, may be worn, and 
this practice is repeated on several of the vases attributed to Asteas (e.g. nos. 2/19, 
22, 26, 36, 45, 51, 64), as well as on his signed phlyax krater in Berlin (no. 2/125). We 
should also note the presence of a white stripe, marking the seam, which runs down 
the arms and legs of the phlyax costume, as on nos. 100 and 102, and on many vases 
from the Asteas-Python workshop; where its appearance may be regarded as almost 
standard practice, although it is not found in Apulian or Campanian. 
On balance, the Leningrad krater seems to me best placed in the present 
context. The obverse is close to that of Lipari 927 (no. 99) and to some of the early 
phlyax vases of Asteas, as mentioned above; the reverse can hardly be regarded as 
true Paestan, but it finds at least distant connections with those of vases in the 
Sicilian Group, and it seems reasonable, in consequence, to place it among those 
vases which mark the transition from the Sicilian forerunners to the standard 
Paestan style. 
3. TWO OTHER TRANSITIONAL VASES 
At this stage we might look at two other vases, which seem to stand between Sicilian 
and Paestan, but which do not find a place in either of the two preceding sections. 
(i) The Malibu Neck-amphora 
Neck-amphora 

*106  Malibu 80 AE 153. Ht. 41.  PLATE 14a,i 
(a) Two youths, with petasoi and staffs, standing beside a tomb-monument, in front of 
which is seated on an altar a draped woman holding a phiale and a fillet, [b) draped woman 
with mirror held out in her r. hand, nude youth with drapery over his 1. arm. 
Neck: (a) female head, in profile to 1., wearing saccos, [b) owl; both between laurel 
branches. 
The subject of the obverse would appear to be a simplified version of the 
meeting of Orestes and Pylades with Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon. Both 
youths wear a short chlamys, fastened at the neck by a brooch, a petasos hanging 
down behind their heads, and high laced boots; each carries a stick. We  may 
therefore assume them to be travellers, and it is in this guise that Orestes and Pylades 
are normally shown (cf. Geneva HR29; no. 2/1). The woman is seated in profile to 
left on an altar in front of a column, round the shaft of which is looped a red fillet. 
She wears a chiton with a double dot-stripe running down the left side, a white-
studded girdle, and has a piece of dot-stripe bordered drapery across the lower part 
of her body. In her left hand she holds a phiale, not the hydria which is usually 
associated with Electra in this context, but it is difficult to think of her as anyone else, 
since the scene follows so closely the regular composition for this theme. On the 
reverse, a woman with a dot-stripe bordered cloak on top of her tunic and draped 
over her right shoulder holds out a mirror in her left hand; before her stands a nude 
youth, a piece of drapery "wrapped around his left arm and falling down towards the 
ground. Between them is a very low altar or stele. The stance and draping of the 
woman recall the figures on the reverses of kraters by the Painter of Louvre K 236 
(e.g. nos. 62-4). On the neck of the obverse are the head and shoulders of a woman, 
seen in profile to left, wearing a saccos decorated with rows of dots, from which a 
large bunch of curly hair emerges to cover the left ear, from which hangs a three-
bead earring. Round the shoulder runs a laurel-wreath meeting in a central white 
flower, which has now disappeared. The drawing of the faces, the rendering of the 
drapery, the treatment of the reverse all have a good deal in common with early 
Paestan, but the vase does not seem quite to belong to the fabric and it is therefore 
better to think of it rather as an immediate forerunner, which may well have had 
some influence on the Geneva amphora. It is unfortunate that there is no record of 
its find-spot. 
(ii) The Mormino Hydria
